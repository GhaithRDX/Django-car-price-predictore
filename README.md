# Overview

The Django Car Price Prediction Web App is a Django-based application that allows users to estimate the price of a car by inputting relevant features such as make, model, and year. Leveraging machine learning techniques, the app provides accurate predictions to assist both buyers and sellers in the second-hand car market.

# Features

    User-Friendly Interface: The web app offers a simple HTML form where users can easily input car details.
    Machine Learning Model: Behind the scenes, weâ€™ve trained a machine learning model using historical car data.
    Predictive Power: By analyzing attributes like kilometers driven, age, and previous ownership, the app generates reliable price predictions.
    GitHub Repository: You can find the complete code and model in our GitHub repository.

# How It Works

    Input Features: Users enter car details (make, model, year, etc.) via the web form.
    Model Prediction: The machine learning model processes the input and predicts the carâ€™s price.
